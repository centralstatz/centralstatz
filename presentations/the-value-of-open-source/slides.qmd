# What is AI, anyway?

::: {.notes}
- Today we're going to talk about open source tools
- Why you might consider using them to help you move towards more advanced analytics
- Since we're at an AI conference, we need to talk about it. So we're going to first think about what AI is in the first place
- These views get conflated, often devolving into how we can use the existing tool for our purpose (specifically ChatGPT)
:::

## Two Sides of A Coin

::: {.notes}
- The way I view it, there are two sides of the coin
- Go out to the marketplace and see what's out there to help you accomplish something
- I put "purchase" there intentionally
- A productivity tool, like any other sort of tool. We don't particularly think about how it works.

- The other side is about what actually goes into building those AI tools themselves

### AI as tools

- Pre-built products like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), etc.
- Use (purchase) to conform to our tasks
- Perceived as _productivity tools_

### AI as data science

- Data infrastructure and analytical thinking
- How we use data to inform decision making
- The building blocks of AI itself

## Blurred lines

<br>

::: {.notes}
- So many conflicting definitions of AI, and how it relates to data science
- I intentionally chose this picture because it's just as confusing as stating the definition of AI. 
- There's so much varying overlap that it doesn't actually tell you anything.
- I'm glad regression analysis is actually in there where it is. Very old technique. Going into my first ML class excited to "allow machines to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed". Regression was the first thing I learned about in my machine learning course.

- A lot of focus on the first, often bypassing thoughtfulness in the second
- Gartner (2018): 87% of business at low analytics maturity (REF)
- _"AI for the sake of AI is a losing proposition"_ (REF). Be intentional!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

<center><h2>The AI buzz</h2></center>

- AI is many things
- Ambiguity from _"Buy in or fall behind"_
- Spend money on expensive products, and expect results
- Quite the jump

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

<center><h2>Data Science</h2></center>

- Comes down to asking the right questions that lead to actionable solutions
- Data quality, strategy, tooling, and smart analysis goes a long way
- You can start doing that without breaking the bank
